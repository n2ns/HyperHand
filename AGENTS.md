# HyperHand Project Guide

## Project and callers

- HyperHand is an MCP server that lets AI agents see and operate Windows virtual machines on Hyper-V.
- The callers and the readers of every result are AI agents, not people. Design tool descriptions, return text and error messages for AI usability: as few calls per task as possible, machine-readable results that carry the facts the next call needs (actual handles, coordinates and so on), errors that state the cause and the next action. Make these trade-offs yourself; do not ask the user about them as if they were human UI preferences.
- Architecture, the tool list and exact behavior are in `README.md`, `docs/user-guide.md` and `docs/features.md`.

## Test VMs are disposable

- Develop and accept HyperHand on the `Win10` VM. `Win10-PipeSifu` belongs to PipeSifu testing; do not use it for HyperHand work.
- The Hyper-V VMs this project is developed and tested against can be thrown away and rebuilt at any time.
- Do not worry about, warn about or ask about security inside the VMs: automatic logon, plain-text passwords, disabling UAC prompts, lowering security policy, passing passwords through `vm_exec` and the like. Whatever gets the automated tests running, do it the simplest way.
- This applies to the guest VMs only. Accounts, permissions and security settings on the host (the physical machine) are still handled with care: do not change the user's own account or its group memberships. The installer's changes to the dedicated service account are part of the product and are not affected.

## Build and verify

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
go build -ldflags "-H windowsgui" -o build\hyperhand.exe .\cmd\hyperhand
go build -ldflags "-H windowsgui" -o build\hyperhand-agent.exe .\cmd\hyperhand-agent
go vet ./cmd/... ./internal/...
go test -race ./cmd/... ./internal/...
scripts\restart-tray.ps1   # reinstalls the host components from build\ and restarts them, one UAC prompt
```

- Test `./cmd/...` and `./internal/...`, not `./...`: the ignored `build\` directory holds old Go experiments that no longer compile.
- The running service and tray use the installed copies under `%ProgramFiles%\HyperHand`; the files in `build\` are not the running version. Update the guest agent with `vm_update_agent`.
- Never kill processes by name (`taskkill /IM`, `Stop-Process -Name`); the installer owns service and tray replacement.
- Do not add PowerShell or batch to the installer (`cmd/hyperhand/setup_*.go`).
- When a change to `internal/proto` alters what the host and agent exchange, increment `proto.Protocol`; the host refuses older agents with `agent_outdated` and there is no compatibility path.
- A behavior change updates `docs/features.md` (the exact behavior), `docs/user-guide.md` where usage changes, and `[Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog format), in the same commit. Releasing: see the Releasing section of `docs/user-guide.md`.
